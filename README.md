--- DAE Regression Analysis Project ---
The dataset in question contains data from 178 countries. It contains information about the countries, highest point, lowest point (Minimum.elevation), total area, land area, water area and population circa 2023. For our regression analysis project our aim will be to construct a model which estimates the highest point of elevation. The data comes from various wikipedia tables and some countries may be excluded simply for having multiple names. For purposes of this assignment, we will assume that the list is complete


--- CIFAR10 Image Classification ---
For our project we will be looking at the task of image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Researchers often use the CIFAR-10 dataset to benchmark their algorithms and compare their performance against state-of-the-art methods. It has become a standard dataset for evaluating the effectiveness of various deep learning architectures and techniques. In this project, we wish to investigate the difference in performance between two neural network architectures, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Traditional neural networks (TNNs), to understand how their structures are adapted for image classification. We also explore some techniques on how to make our models more accurate.
